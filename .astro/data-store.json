[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) seems like the gold standard here and claims to be simple, but my first impression after looking into the documentation was anything but. I erroneously expected \"simple\" to mean \"opinionated\", and was immediately overwhelmed by the various template languages and convoluted documentation.\n\nThen I remembered a framework I had heard about a while back: [Astro](https://astro.build). This shiny new version of the site is built with it, on top of the default blog template. It was very easy to set up, and the blog template contained almost all the functionality I had in my SvelteKit version, except that it was all there pre-built with less code. I could also keep using Svelte components if needed! The cube spinning on the front page at the time of writing is running on the magnificent [Threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) library that binds Three.js and Svelte together. I'd like the front page to show some flashy 3D animation, and learn some shader programming while doing that.\n\nThe color palette of the site is based on my favourite IDE theme, [Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim).\n\nLet's see where this site grows!","src/content/writing/initial-commit.md","05bd6f84a6e8d36b",{"html":21,"metadata":22},"\u003Cp>Recently, I've been reading quite a few interesting tech and non-tech blogs I've stumbled upon on, and, like many do, got the itch to start my own online plot of land to lay open my projects and writings on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I built the first version of this site with my favourite web framework, \u003Ca href=\"https://kit.svelte.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SvelteKit\u003C/a>, and the \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MDsveX\u003C/a> library for parsing markdown content.
